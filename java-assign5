Q1. What is Exception in Java?
In Java, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of instructions.
It represents an error, unexpected condition, or exceptional situation that needs to be handled by the program. When an exception occurs, it generates an object, known as an exception object,
which contains information about the type of exception and the context in which it occurred.

Here are the key aspects of exceptions in Java:

1. Exception Handling:
   - Exception handling is a mechanism provided by Java to deal with exceptions and handle them gracefully.
   - It allows you to catch and handle exceptions to prevent program termination and provide alternative paths of execution.

2. Exception Hierarchy:
   - Java has a hierarchy of exception classes that are derived from the base class java.lang.Throwable.
   - Exceptions are classified into two categories: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions (also known as runtime exceptions).
   - Checked exceptions are checked by the compiler and must be either caught using a try-catch block or declared in the method's throws clause.
   - Unchecked exceptions do not need to be explicitly caught or declared.

3. try-catch Block:
   - The `try-catch` block is used to catch and handle exceptions.
   - The code that may potentially throw an exception is placed within the try block, and the corresponding exception-handling code is placed within the catch block.
   - If an exception occurs within the try block, the execution jumps to the appropriate catch block that can handle that exception.

4. finally Block:
   - The finally block is optional and can be used alongside the try-catch block.
   - The code within the finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
   - It is typically used to release resources or perform cleanup tasks that need to be executed regardless of exceptions.

5. Throwing Exceptions:
   - Java also allows you to explicitly throw exceptions using the throw keyword.
   - You can create and throw exception objects to indicate exceptional situations within your code.
   - The thrown exception can be caught and handled by a higher-level `try-catch` block.

Example

public class ExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = divide(10, 0); // Potential exception
            System.out.println("Result: " + result); // This line is not executed
        } catch (ArithmeticException ex) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + ex.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block executed");
        }
    }

    public static int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        return dividend / divisor; // ArithmeticException may be thrown here
    }
}

Q2.What is Exception Handling?
Exception handling is a mechanism in programming that allows developers to manage and respond to exceptional or erroneous situations that may occur during the execution of a program.
It involves identifying potential exceptions, handling them gracefully, and providing alternative paths of execution when unexpected or exceptional conditions arise.
Exception handling helps prevent program termination and improves the overall reliability and stability of software systems.

Here are the key aspects of exception handling:

1. Exception Types:
   - Exceptions can be classified into two main categories: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions (runtime exceptions).
   - Checked exceptions are exceptions that must be either caught and handled using a try-catch block or declared in the method's throws clause. They are checked by the compiler at compile-time.
   - Unchecked exceptions, also known as runtime exceptions, do not need to be explicitly caught or declared. They are not checked by the compiler and can occur during runtime.

2. try-catch Block:
   - The try-catch block is used to catch and handle exceptions.
   - The code that may potentially throw an exception is placed within the try block.
   - If an exception occurs within the try block, the execution jumps to the appropriate catch block that can handle that specific type of exception.
   - The catch block specifies the exception type to be caught and provides the code to be executed for handling that exception.
   - Multiple catch  blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions.

3. finally Block:
   - The finally block is an optional block that can be used alongside the try-catch block.
   - The code within the finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
   - It is typically used to release resources, close files, or perform cleanup tasks that need to be executed regardless of exceptions.

4. Throwing Exceptions:
   - Exceptions can also be explicitly thrown using the throw keyword.
   - Developers can create and throw exception objects to indicate exceptional situations within their code.
   - The thrown exception can be caught and handled by a higher-level `try-catch` block.

Example:
public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = divide(10, 0); // Potential exception
            System.out.println("Result: " + result); // This line is not executed
        } catch (ArithmeticException ex) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + ex.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block executed");
        }
    }

    public static int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        return dividend / divisor; // ArithmeticException may be thrown here
    }
}

Q3.What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions and Error?

1. Checked Exceptions:
   - Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked by the compiler at compile-time.
   - They are subclasses of Exception, excluding subclasses of RuntimeException and Error.
   - Checked exceptions represent exceptional conditions that a well-behaved program might want to handle.
   - Examples of checked exceptions in Java include IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, etc.
   - Checked exceptions must be either caught and handled using a try-catch block or declared in the method's throws clause.
   - The calling code must handle the checked exception or propagate it further using the throws clause.

2. Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions):
   - Unchecked exceptions, also known as runtime exceptions, are exceptions that do not need to be checked by the compiler at compile-time.
   - They are subclasses of RuntimeException, including subclasses of Error.
   - Unchecked exceptions represent exceptional conditions that are generally caused by programming errors or unforeseen situations.
   - Examples of unchecked exceptions in Java include NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, IllegalArgumentException, etc.
   - Unchecked exceptions do not require explicit handling or declaration. It is not mandatory to catch or declare them.
   - The calling code may choose to catch and handle unchecked exceptions, but it is not enforced by the compiler.

3. Errors:
   - Errors are exceptional conditions that typically indicate serious problems that are beyond the control of the application.
   - Errors are subclasses of Error, and they are not meant to be caught or handled by regular application code.
   - Examples of errors in Java include OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, AssertionError, etc.
   - Errors usually represent situations that cannot be recovered from and indicate severe problems in the JVM or the environment.
   - Errors are generally not caught or handled by application code. Instead, they are often logged or reported for diagnosis and debugging.

Q4.What are the difference between throw and throws in Java?

Throw:
The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from within a method or block of code.
It is followed by an exception object or an expression that evaluates to an exception object.
When an exception is thrown, the normal flow of the program is disrupted, and the exception is propagated up the call stack in search of an appropriate exception handler.
The throw statement is typically used to signal exceptional or error conditions within the code.
Example:
void divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
    if (divisor == 0) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
    }
    // Perform division
}

Throws:
The throws keyword is used in the method declaration to specify that the method may throw one or more types of exceptions.
It is followed by the list of exception types separated by commas.
When a method is declared with the throws clause, it means that the method can potentially throw those exceptions during its execution.
The responsibility of handling or propagating the thrown exceptions lies with the caller of the method.
Example:
void readFile() throws IOException {
    // Code to read a file
}

Q5.What is multithreading in Java? mention its advantages
Multithreading in Java refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program.
A thread is a lightweight unit of execution that represents an independent path of execution within a program.
Multithreading allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently, enabling efficient utilization of system resources and improving the responsiveness and performance of applications. 

Advantages of multithreading in Java include:

1. Increased Responsiveness: Multithreading allows a program to remain responsive even while performing time-consuming tasks. 
By executing tasks concurrently in separate threads, the program can continue to respond to user interactions and handle other activities without getting blocked.

2. Improved Performance: Multithreading can lead to improved performance by utilizing the available CPU cores and parallelizing the execution of tasks. 
By dividing the workload among multiple threads, it allows for efficient utilization of system resources and faster completion of tasks.

3. Enhanced Concurrency: Multithreading enables concurrent execution of multiple tasks, facilitating the execution of multiple operations simultaneously.
This is particularly useful in scenarios where different parts of a program need to perform independent operations concurrently.

4. Simplified Task Management: Multithreading simplifies the management of complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable threads.
Each thread can handle a specific part of the task, making it easier to implement and maintain complex systems.

5. Resource Sharing: Multithreading allows threads to share data and resources, enabling efficient communication and coordination between different parts of a program.
This promotes collaboration and facilitates the exchange of information between threads.

6. Asynchronous Programming: Multithreading supports asynchronous programming, where tasks can be initiated and executed independently, without waiting for the completion of other tasks.
This enables the efficient handling of I/O operations, network requests, and other time-consuming operations.

7. Background Processing: Multithreading is commonly used for performing background processing or background tasks that run concurrently with the main execution flow.
This is useful for tasks such as file downloading, data processing, periodic updates, and continuous monitoring.

8. Responsiveness in GUI Applications: Multithreading is essential in graphical user interface (GUI) applications to ensure responsiveness.
By executing time-consuming operations in separate threads, the GUI remains responsive and can update the user interface without delays or freezing.

Overall, multithreading in Java provides significant advantages in terms of improved responsiveness, enhanced performance, simplified task management, and efficient utilization of system resources. 
It is widely used in various domains such as server applications, concurrent programming, parallel processing, GUI applications, and more.

Q6.Write a program to create and call a custom exception

// Custom exception class
class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

// Class that throws the custom exception
class MyClass {
    public void performOperation() throws CustomException {
        // Condition that triggers the custom exception
        boolean condition = true;
        
        if (condition) {
            throw new CustomException("Custom exception occurred");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Operation performed successfully");
        }
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate calling the custom exception
public class CustomExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        
        try {
            obj.performOperation(); // Call the method that throws the custom exception
        } catch (CustomException e) {
            System.out.println("Custom Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}


############################################################################################################################################
Q7.How can you handle exceptions in Java? 
In Java, exceptions can be handled using the try-catch block, which allows you to catch and handle specific exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code

try Block:
The code that may potentially throw an exception is enclosed within a try block.
If an exception occurs within the try block, the normal flow of execution is interrupted, and the program jumps to the appropriate catch block.

catch Block:
A catch block follows the try block and is used to catch and handle specific types of exceptions.
Each catch block specifies the type of exception it can handle using the catch keyword followed by the exception type in parentheses.
If an exception of the specified type occurs within the try block, the corresponding catch block is executed.
You can have multiple catch blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

Exception Handling:
Within the catch block, you write code to handle the exception or perform any necessary actions.
This can include displaying an error message, logging the exception, or taking appropriate measures to recover from the exception.
It's important to handle exceptions in a way that maintains program stability and provides meaningful feedback to users.

finally Block:
The finally block is optional and follows the catch block (or a series of catch blocks).
The code within the finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
It is commonly used to release resources or perform cleanup tasks that need to be executed regardless of exceptions.
The finally block is executed even if there is a return statement in the preceding try or catch blocks.

EXAMPLE:
public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = divide(10, 0); // Potential exception
            System.out.println("Result: " + result); // This line is not executed
        } catch (ArithmeticException ex) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + ex.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block executed");
        }
    }

    public static int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        return dividend / divisor; // ArithmeticException may be thrown here
    }
}

Q8.What is Thread in Java?
A thread refers to a lightweight unit of execution within a program. It is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by the operating system's scheduler.
Threads allow concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single program, enabling efficient utilization of system resources and facilitating concurrent programming.

Thread Creation:
In Java, you can create threads by either extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.
When extending the Thread class, you override the run() method to define the thread's behavior.

Multithreading:
Multithreading refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program.
Multithreading allows different parts of a program to execute independently and simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness.

Thread States:
Threads in Java have different states, including:
NEW: The thread is created but not started yet.
RUNNABLE: The thread is executing or ready to execute.
BLOCKED: The thread is waiting for a monitor lock to enter a synchronized block or method.
WAITING: The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread's notification.
TIMED_WAITING: The thread is waiting for another thread's notification for a specific period of time.
TERMINATED: The thread has completed its execution and terminated.

############################################################################################################################################
Q9. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java?
1 Extending the Thread Class:
The first way to implement threads is by creating a subclass of the Thread class and overriding its run() method.
The run() method contains the code that will be executed by the thread.
To start the thread, you create an instance of the subclass and call its start() method.
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed by the thread
    }
}

// Creating and starting the thread
MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
myThread.start();


2 Implementing the Runnable Interface:
The second way to implement threads is by implementing the Runnable interface and providing the thread's behavior in the run() method.
This approach is preferred in Java because it allows for better code organization and flexibility since it doesn't restrict the subclassing of other classes.
To create a thread, you create an instance of a class that implements Runnable and pass it to a Thread object.
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed by the thread
    }
}

// Creating and starting the thread
MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
Thread thread = new Thread(myRunnable);
thread.start();

Q10.What do you mean by garbage collection?
Garbage collection in programming refers to the automatic memory management process where the programming language or runtime system deallocates memory that is no longer needed by the program.
It is responsible for reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable or in use by the program.

In languages like Java, C#, and Python, which employ automatic garbage collection, the process is typically performed by a garbage collector. Here's how garbage collection works:

1. Memory Allocation:
   - When objects are created dynamically during program execution, memory is allocated to store these objects.
   - Memory allocation can be explicit, such as using the new keyword in Java, or implicit, such as when objects are created within a method or function.
   - The allocated memory is organized into different regions, such as the heap and stack.

2. Identifying Reachable Objects:
   - During program execution, the runtime system keeps track of objects that are reachable or actively used by the program.
   - Objects that are reachable have references pointing to them from active variables, data structures, or the program's execution stack.

3. Marking and Sweep:
   - The garbage collector periodically performs a process called "mark and sweep" to identify and reclaim memory occupied by unreachable objects.
   - The first phase, marking, involves traversing through the heap and marking all reachable objects as "in-use" or "live."
   - The second phase, sweep, involves scanning through the entire heap and deallocating memory occupied by objects that were not marked as live during the marking phase.
   - The memory deallocation process frees up memory for future allocations and ensures efficient memory usage.

4. Memory Defragmentation:
   - In addition to memory deallocation, some garbage collectors also perform memory defragmentation.
   - During defragmentation, the memory is compacted, and fragmented free memory blocks are merged to create larger contiguous blocks.
   - This helps avoid memory fragmentation and improves memory allocation efficiency.

The benefits of garbage collection include:

- Simplified memory management: 
- Increased productivity: 
- Memory optimization: 
- Avoidance of memory-related bugs: 
- Dynamic memory allocation:
